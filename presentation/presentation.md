## The Ground is Shaking!
Until recently when people thought of where earthquakes occurred in the U.S. the did not think of Oklahoma!
Earthquakes in the eastern 2/3's of the US were rare. Some occurring in the in the Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tenseness region.

### Majority of Quakes Today (mag 2 and larger)
- California: Mainly along the coast and some the Sierra mountains
- Oklahoma: Central/Northern Oklahoma!


========================================================
## Oklahome: Increase in frequency
The images show a dramatic increase in the Oklahoma area. Both show only 2.3 or larger 
quakes, the minimum magnitude in the data for 2006.

The increasing counts may be due to changing methods of detection; however, a new cluster of quakes is present in Oklahoma (central U.S.A.)

Count Summary
